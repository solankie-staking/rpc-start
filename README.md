## About This Project (Archived)

This repository originally included a `systemd` service file to run a backend process exposing **RPC** and **gRPC** interfaces—typically used for validator nodes or internal backend services.

It featured:

- System-level service management with `systemd`
- Port exposure for RPC and gRPC interfaces
- Auto-restart and log capture via `journald`

## Why It’s Deprecated

This implementation has been superseded by a more robust, maintainable, and extensible setup located in the new [`rpc-start`](https://github.com/brewlabshq/rpc-start) repository.
